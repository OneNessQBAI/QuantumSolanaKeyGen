Summary of the Code: QuantumSolanaKeygen
This code implements a quantum-assisted key generation and verification system for Solana private-public key pairs using Cirq, a Python framework for quantum computing. The focus is on memory efficiency by processing the private key in small blocks and using quantum circuits to perform transformations.

Key Features of the Code:
Memory-Efficient Quantum Processing:

The private key is processed in blocks of 8 bits (1 byte at a time), minimizing memory usage during quantum operations.
Quantum Circuit Design:

A quantum circuit is created for each block of bits. Operations include:
Initialization: Converting classical bits into quantum states using 
ùëã
X-gates.
Quantum Transformations: Applying Hadamard (
ùêª
H) gates and controlled NOT (
ùê∂
ùëÅ
ùëÇ
ùëá
CNOT) gates to create entanglement.
Measurement: Collapsing quantum states back to classical bits.
Key Generation:

The private key (Base58-encoded) is decoded and processed block-by-block.
Each block is passed through the quantum circuit, and the results are combined.
The classical verification ensures that the generated public key matches Solana's expected cryptographic standards.
Verification:

After generating the public key, it is compared with the expected public key using classical cryptographic methods (NaCl library).
Functionality:
Quantum Key Generation:

The private key (in Base58 format) is divided into 32 blocks (1 byte each).
Each block undergoes quantum processing to produce transformed outputs.
The resulting outputs are used to verify consistency with the classical cryptographic library (nacl.signing).
Public Key Verification:

The program verifies whether the quantum-generated public key matches the expected public key.
Error Handling:

Exception handling ensures errors (e.g., decoding issues) are caught and logged for debugging.
Test Cases:
The program includes two test cases with valid Solana private-public key pairs:
